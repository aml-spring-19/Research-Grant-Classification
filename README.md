The overall goal of this project is to predict whether a payment by a company to a medical doctor or facility was made as part of a research project or not.

We build the dataset from OpenPayments data, extract features, apply some preprocessing steps, fit a baseline model, do more feature engineering, build a more complex model, do some feature selection and finally build an interpretable model using all the insights gained from the previous steps.
